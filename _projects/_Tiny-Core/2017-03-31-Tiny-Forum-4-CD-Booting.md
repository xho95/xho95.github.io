Thank you everybody.

As your suggestion, I made a small core bootable CD and booted with it.

If I do all the work on small core linux, everything is going to well. OK?

And is it right that I have to work here to develop my program to create a tcz file?

Anyway I'm going to try a few things. 

Thank you.
